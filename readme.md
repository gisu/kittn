## Introduction

Kittn is not a pure CSS Framework, it is rather a collection of several components that will help the developers to work on the frontend.

The CSS does not offer Part prefabricated elements, like Bootstrap, it gives the developer rather the mixins in hand, to generate elements.

Around the CSS part is a set of Grunt / Gulp task, bringing the eigentiche work is automated. My goal was to minimize errors in the daily Development by rules.
